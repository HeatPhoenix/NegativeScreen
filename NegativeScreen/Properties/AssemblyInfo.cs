@"The original purpose of NegativeScreen was to simply invert your screen's colors.
This can be useful, for example when using a computer in a dark room and the screen is dazzling you.

The name stuck, but you can now use NegativeScreen to apply any color effect that can be modeled as a color transformation matrix.
